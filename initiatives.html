      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">Installing solar-powered phone charging stations in public places is a smart, eco-friendly, and practical project. These small stations use solar panels to allow people to charge their phones for free using clean energy. They can be placed in parks, schoolyards, university campuses, or public squares. Besides being a useful service, the stations act as educational tools—each one can display information about solar energy, its benefits, and simple eco-friendly habits. This project encourages the use of renewable energy while visibly promoting your group’s environmental commitment to the wider community.</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">Implementing a proper waste sorting and recycling system in schools is an educational project with a long-term impact. It begins with an analysis of the types of waste produced—paper, plastic, organic, etc.—followed by the installation of clearly labeled recycling bins throughout the school. The success of the project depends on raising awareness among students, teachers, and staff through posters, classroom presentations, and fun activities. Creative recycling workshops can be organized to turn waste into useful or artistic items. Collaborations with local authorities or recycling companies can help with regular collection. This initiative teaches young people about responsible consumption and helps reduce waste in educational settings.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">A bike repair workshop aims to give a second life to abandoned or unused bicycles while encouraging sustainable transportation. The concept involves collecting old bikes, repairing or upgrading them, and then offering them for rent or loan—especially to students, job seekers, or low-income individuals. The workshop can become a learning space where participants are trained in bike mechanics and maintenance. Volunteers or local mechanics can lead the sessions. The project can also include community bike rides, car-free days, and awareness campaigns on the environmental and health benefits of cycling. This is a project that combines social impact, environmental benefits, and practical skills development.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">This project encourages each class to reduce its waste as much as possible over a certain period—like one week or one month. Students are involved in sorting waste, reducing plastic use, reusing materials, and composting food scraps. Teachers can include lessons about waste, pollution, and sustainable consumption in their subjects. You can set up a scoreboard to create friendly competition between classes, and reward the most eco-friendly one. It helps raise awareness of daily habits and shows that small changes can have a big impact.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">Create a small garden with plants that attract bees, butterflies, and other pollinators. This helps biodiversity and offers a beautiful green space in the school. Students can be involved in planning, planting, and taking care of the garden. Signs can be added to explain the importance of pollinators and the role they play in food production. This project combines biology, environmental science, and art (with handmade signs and decorations).

      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">Instead of throwing away old materials, students collect and reuse them to create useful objects, furniture, or art pieces. This project encourages creativity and environmental responsibility. You can organize a school-wide upcycling competition or exhibition. Materials might include plastic bottles, cans, cardboard, old clothes, etc. It’s an ideal cross-disciplinary project that can involve both science and art classes.</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-10 text-[#333333]">Organize a one-day or one-week challenge where students reduce their screen time and focus on offline activities like reading, nature walks, or crafts. Pair this with awareness posters around the school about the environmental impact of digital pollution (data centers, device production, energy use). This encourages mindfulness, better mental health, and awareness of the hidden impact of technology on the environment.

They can run campaigns, check if lights are turned off, monitor recycling bins, create posters, and organize eco-days. It gives students leadership roles while promoting environmental responsibility among their peers. Teachers can help by acting as coordinators.</p>
